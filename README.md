# VectorFPGA
This is a WIP for an analog vector generator using an FPGA.
This project was heavily inspired by the [v.st](https://github.com/osresearch/vst) project (and borrows some demo code), but offers various improvements, including greatly increased speed and no dependence on a microcontroller.
